**Requirements & Specification Document**

An AI-Driven Patient Management Solution designed on a complete Microsoft Stack



# Prompt

Write a comprehensive requirements and specification document for a modern, AI-driven Patient Management System (PMS) designed as a SaaS, multi-tenant web application. The solution must use a full Microsoft stack, including ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, Azure SQL, Azure Services, Aspire for orchestration, YARP as an API gateway, and Microsoft Semantic Kernel for AI features.

The requirements should include:

Business requirements and use cases for patient registration, appointment scheduling, clinical records, billing, reporting, and analytics.
AI and conversational elements (chatbot, semantic search, clinician insights).
SaaS multi-tenancy: company registration, user login with personal accounts, company data segmentation, and tenant-aware security.
Technical requirements for architecture, authentication, data isolation, and Azure integration.
Use cases for YARP and Semantic Kernel.
Non-functional requirements (scalability, security, compliance, extensibility).
Present the requirements in a way that guides the design and implementation of such a system.


## 1. Overview

The Patient Management System (PMS) is a modern, cloud-native web application designed to streamline healthcare operations, improve patient engagement, and enhance clinical workflows. Built on a full Microsoft stack, the system leverages Azure services, Entity Framework Core, Aspire for orchestration, YARP for API gateway, and integrates AI-driven features using Semantic Kernel and conversational bots.

## 2. Business Requirements

### 2.1. Core Features Use Cases

#### Patient Registration & Profiles
1. As a receptionist, I want to register a new patient with their demographic, contact, and insurance details so that they can access services.
2. As a patient, I want to view and update my profile so that my information is always current.
3. As a staff member, I want to upload and manage patient documents (e.g., ID, insurance cards) for record-keeping and verification.

#### Appointment Scheduling
4. As a patient, I want to book, reschedule, or cancel appointments so that I can manage my healthcare visits.
5. As a clinician, I want to view my calendar of appointments so I can plan my day efficiently.
6. As a patient, I want to receive automated reminders via email or SMS so I don’t miss appointments.

#### Clinical Records Management
7. As a clinician, I want to record and retrieve a patient’s medical history, allergies, medications, and visit notes so I can provide informed care.
8. As an admin, I want secure storage and access control for sensitive data to ensure patient privacy and compliance.

#### Billing & Invoicing
9. As an admin, I want to generate invoices for consultations and procedures so that billing is accurate and timely.
10. As a patient, I want to view and track my payments and outstanding balances for transparency.

#### Reporting & Analytics
11. As an admin, I want to generate reports on appointments, patient demographics, and financials to support decision-making.
12. As a manager, I want a dashboard for key performance indicators to monitor the health of the practice.

### 2.2. AI & Conversational Elements

- **AI Chatbot for Patients**  
  - 24/7 virtual assistant for appointment booking, FAQs, and basic triage.
  - Natural language understanding for patient queries.
  - Integration with clinical workflows (e.g., appointment scheduling, reminders).

- **AI-Driven Insights for Clinicians**  
  - Summarize patient history and suggest next steps.
  - Predictive analytics for no-shows and patient risk stratification.

- **Semantic Search**  
  - Use Semantic Kernel to enable context-aware search across patient records and documentation.

### 2.3. SaaS & Multi-Tenant Use Cases

#### Company Registration & Onboarding
13. As a new user, I want to register a new company (tenant) so that my organization can use the system.
14. As an admin, I want to invite users to join my company so that they can access company-specific data and features.

#### User Login & Access
15. As a user, I want to log in with my personal account and be associated with my company so that I only see my organization's data.
16. As a user with access to multiple companies, I want to select which company context I am operating in after login.
17. As a user, I want to securely log out and switch companies if needed.

#### Data Segmentation & Security
18. As a user, I want to be assured that my company's data is completely isolated from other companies using the system.
19. As an admin, I want to manage company-specific settings, users, and permissions.

## 3. Technical Requirements


### 3.1. Architecture

- **Full Microsoft Stack**  
  - ASP.NET Core for web APIs and frontend (Blazor or React with TypeScript).
  - Entity Framework Core for ORM and data access.
  - SQL Server (Azure SQL) as the primary database.
  - Microsoft or Google for user authentication

- **Cloud-Native & Orchestration**  
  - Use Aspire for orchestrating microservices, background jobs, and infrastructure.
  - Deploy on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure Container Apps.

- **API Gateway**  
  - Use YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy) for routing, load balancing, and securing APIs.

#### YARP Use Cases
  - Centralized API gateway for all microservices, enabling unified routing and security policies.
  - Dynamic routing of requests to backend services based on user roles (e.g., patient, clinician, admin).
  - Load balancing and failover for high availability of patient and appointment services.
  - Secure exposure of internal APIs to external clients with authentication and rate limiting.
  - Aggregation of multiple backend responses for dashboard and reporting endpoints.

- **AI & Semantic Kernel**  
  - Integrate Microsoft Semantic Kernel for semantic search and AI-driven features.
  - Use Azure OpenAI or Azure Cognitive Services for natural language processing and chatbot capabilities.

#### Semantic Kernel (SK) Use Cases
  - Enable semantic search across patient records, clinical notes, and documentation for clinicians and staff.
  - Power the AI chatbot to understand and respond to natural language queries from patients (e.g., "When is my next appointment?").
  - Summarize patient history and generate insights for clinicians using context-aware AI prompts.
  - Automate triage and suggest next steps for patients based on their input and medical history.
  - Enhance reporting by allowing users to ask questions in natural language and receive data-driven answers.

- **Azure Services**  
  - Azure Blob Storage for document management.
  - Azure Service Bus for messaging between services.
  - Azure Monitor and Application Insights for logging and monitoring.

### 3.2. Security & Compliance

- Role-based access control (RBAC) for patients, clinicians, and admins.
- Data encryption at rest and in transit.
- Audit logging for sensitive operations.
- Compliance with HIPAA/GDPR as applicable.

### 3.3. SaaS Multi-Tenancy & Data Segmentation

- The application must support multi-tenancy, with each company (tenant) having logically isolated data.
- All user accounts must be linked to a company (tenant) context.
- Users may belong to one or more companies, with the ability to switch context after login.
- Data access at all layers (API, database, UI) must be filtered by tenant ID to prevent data leakage.
- Use Azure Active Directory B2C or similar for authentication, supporting both individual and company-level access control.
- EF Core should implement tenant-aware data models, using a TenantId field in all relevant tables and applying global query filters.
- Company registration workflow must create a new tenant context and default admin user.
- Administrative actions (user invites, company settings) must be scoped to the current tenant.
